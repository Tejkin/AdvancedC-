# Habit Manager API Documentation

## Part 1 - Overview

The `Habit` class is designed to manage habits, which are repeating tasks but with an extra goal of maintaing its streak. It builds upon the functionality of the `RepeatingTask` class to track the current and longest streaks of habit completions.
```csharp
public class Habit : RepeatingTask
```
Inheritance: RepeatingTask â†’ Habit


### Properties

   - **Description**: The current streak of consecutive habit completions.
